   - Choose between OpenAI, HuggingFace, or local LLMs.
2. **Backend Integration**
   - Implement backend endpoints to send/receive code context and suggestions.
   - Handle authentication and rate limiting for external APIs.
3. **Frontend Integration**
   - Add UI for inline code suggestions, explanations, and chat-based help.
   - Display AI-powered refactoring and linting results.
4. **Feedback Loop**
   - Allow users to accept, reject, or rate AI suggestions.

## 9. Testing & QA
1. **Unit Tests**
   - Write tests for backend APIs and frontend components.
2. **Integration & E2E Tests**
