# Real-time Collaboration in AurA (Deep Dive)

This guide details the implementation of real-time collaboration, inspired by VSCode Live Share, Cursor, and Claude IDE.

---

## 1. CRDT Integration
### Overview & Goals
- Enable multi-user, conflict-free collaborative editing.

### Implementation Steps
- Use [Yjs](https://github.com/yjs/yjs) or [Automerge](https://github.com/automerge/automerge) for CRDT.
- Integrate with Monaco or CodeMirror for shared document state.

```js
import * as Y from 'yjs';
const ydoc = new Y.Doc();
const ytext = ydoc.getText('monaco');
```

### Advanced Usage
- Support collaborative cursors, selections, and undo/redo.
- Allow plugins to extend CRDT data model.

### Error Handling
- Handle network partitions and merge conflicts.

### Security
- Encrypt document updates in transit.

### Testing
- Simulate concurrent edits and network failures.

---

## 2. WebSocket Sync
### Overview & Goals
- Synchronize document state in real time across clients.

### Implementation Steps
- Use [y-websocket](https://github.com/yjs/y-websocket) server for sync.
- Connect each client to the same room/channel.

```js
import { WebsocketProvider } from 'y-websocket';
const provider = new WebsocketProvider('wss://localhost:1234', 'room-name', ydoc);
```

### Advanced Usage
- Support reconnect and offline editing.
- Optimize for low-latency updates.

### Error Handling
- Handle dropped connections and out-of-sync state.

### Security
- Authenticate users before joining rooms.

### Testing
- Test sync under high latency and reconnect scenarios.

---

## 3. Presence & Awareness
### Overview & Goals
- Show collaborator cursors, selections, and user info in real time.

### Implementation Steps
- Use Yjs awareness protocol to broadcast user state.
- Render collaborator cursors and names in the editor.

### Advanced Usage
- Show avatars, roles, and chat bubbles.
- Allow users to follow each other's cursor.

### Error Handling
- Handle rapid user join/leave events.

### Testing
- Test presence display with many users.

---

## 4. Conflict Resolution
### Overview & Goals
- Ensure all edits are merged without data loss.

### Implementation Steps
- Rely on CRDT for automatic conflict resolution.
- For file/folder ops, use optimistic updates and server reconciliation.

### Advanced Usage
- Allow manual conflict resolution for non-text data.

### Error Handling
- Detect and resolve rare merge anomalies.

### Testing
- Simulate conflicting edits and verify resolution.

---

## 5. Security & Performance
- Encrypt all collaboration traffic.
- Rate limit updates to prevent abuse.
- Optimize for large documents and many users.
