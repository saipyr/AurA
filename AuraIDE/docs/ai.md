# AI-Powered Code Suggestions in AurA (Deep Dive)

This guide details the implementation of AI-powered code suggestions, inspired by VSCode, Cursor, Claude IDE, and Copilot.

---

## 1. Backend Integration
### Overview & Goals
- Integrate with AI providers (OpenAI, HuggingFace, local LLMs) to provide code completions and suggestions.

### Implementation Steps
- Implement backend endpoints to send/receive code context and suggestions.
- Handle authentication, rate limiting, and provider selection.

```python
# Backend (FastAPI, OpenAI example)
import openai
@app.post('/api/ai/complete')
def ai_complete(prompt: str):
    response = openai.Completion.create(
        engine='text-davinci-003',
        prompt=prompt,
        max_tokens=100
    )
    return {'completion': response.choices[0].text}
```

### Advanced Usage
- Support streaming completions for real-time feedback.
- Allow user to select between multiple AI providers.

### Error Handling
- Handle API timeouts, quota errors, and invalid responses.

### Security
- Sanitize all user input sent to AI APIs.
- Protect API keys and sensitive data.

### Testing
- Mock AI responses for backend tests.

---

## 2. Frontend UI for Suggestions
### Overview & Goals
- Provide intuitive UI for inline code suggestions, explanations, and chat-based help.

### Implementation Steps
- Add UI for ghost text, popovers, and accept/reject actions.
- Fetch suggestions from backend and display in editor.

```js
export async function getAICompletion(prompt) {
  const res = await fetch('/api/ai/complete', {
    method: 'POST',
    body: JSON.stringify({ prompt }),
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' }
  });
  return res.json();
}
```

### Advanced Usage
- Allow cycling through multiple suggestions.
- Integrate with chat UI for conversational help.

### Error Handling
- Show fallback UI if AI is unavailable.

### Testing
- UI tests for suggestion rendering and user actions.

---

## 3. Inline Suggestions
### Overview & Goals
- Seamlessly integrate AI suggestions into the code editor.

### Implementation Steps
- Use Monaco's inline completion API or overlay widget.
- Allow users to accept, reject, or cycle through suggestions.

### Advanced Usage
- Support multi-line and context-aware completions.
- Provide explanations or documentation links with suggestions.

### Error Handling
- Handle partial completions and editor state changes.

### Testing
- Test inline suggestion flows and edge cases.

---

## 4. Feedback Loop
### Overview & Goals
- Collect user feedback on AI suggestions to improve quality and analytics.

### Implementation Steps
- Add UI for accept/reject/rate actions.
- Send feedback to backend for logging and model improvement.

### Advanced Usage
- Use feedback to personalize suggestions per user.

### Error Handling
- Handle feedback submission failures gracefully.

### Testing
- Test feedback collection and backend logging.

---

## 5. Security & Performance
- Rate limit AI requests per user/session.
- Cache frequent completions for performance.
